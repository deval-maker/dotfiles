[ ] function navigation
o make the most of these commands, I recommend:
Installing ctags for better code navigation
Using a plugin like coc.nvim or YouCompleteMe for enhanced code navigation
Learning about marks (e.g., ma to set mark 'a', 'a to jump to mark 'a')
These commands should help you navigate through code more efficiently in Vim!
